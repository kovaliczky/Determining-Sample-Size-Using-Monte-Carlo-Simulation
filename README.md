Determining Sample Size Using Monte Carlo Simulation for Measuring the Pattern Completion Ability of 4â€“6 Year-Old Children with Structural Equation Modeling

This project is connected to the research project "Hippocampal Circuit and Code for Cognition Lab (HCCCL)" at the Brain Imaging Centre of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology, within the Brain Structure and Dynamics Research Group, which has been operating since 2018 under the leadership of Attila Keresztes. The aim of the research is to investigate whether the process of pattern completion (discovering regularities) and the process of pattern separation (differentiating specific events and their details) mature at different rates and whether this difference is caused by the varying developmental rates of the brain structures that implement these processes. The research involves longitudinally measuring the performance of 4-6-year-old children using various memory tests linked to different brain processes, enabling the identification of variables that are not directly observable. Additionally, we use high-resolution MRI to examine the maturation differences in the hippocampal subregions. Currently, the pilot study is ongoing, and my thesis is based on these results.

Another aim of the research is to explore which unobservable (latent) memory constructs underlie tasks aimed at measuring pattern completion. Our hypothesis is that a single latent construct represents pattern completion across these tasks. In my thesis, I examined this by comparing two models: one containing a single latent construct (a one-factor model) and one containing two latent constructs (a two-factor model). I hypothesized that the one-factor model represents pattern completion, while the two-factor model represents the classical explicit-implicit memory distinction. I investigated all this as a function of sample size using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to draw reliable statistical conclusions about the differences between the models. Since sufficient data could not be collected during the pilot study to fit the models, I used Monte Carlo simulation to generate the data, utilizing the pilot study results to estimate the input parameters for the simulation.
